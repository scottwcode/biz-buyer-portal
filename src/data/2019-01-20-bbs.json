This is an established business with a long list of opportunities for growth and a minimal amount of work required to maintain.    The site primarily relies on organic search traffic from Google. There are social media profiles for Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, Google+, and Pinterest, but they arenâ€™t used for driving traffic to the site. An email list hasnâ€™t been created for the business, so this is something to keep in mind for growthÂ  opportunities.    The Seller has done veryÂ little work on the site over the past yearÂ or so. They've updated someÂ content and added a few new pages. Existing content was written by the Seller, their wife,Â and aÂ friend familiar with theÂ niche. While content hasn't been actively added recently, starting to do so would be a growth opportunity for the Buyer to consider. Content related to winter outdoorÂ gear, for example, would also help to level out any summer seasonality.    * PBN linksÂ were systematically added over time from a service. The current count is just over 40 links. Most were added a very long time ago, and the Seller feels thatÂ they don't necessarilyÂ affect rankings anymore. The Buyer can choose toÂ continue paying monthly for the links or remove them. More information can be provided to active depositors.    * A site created in 2015 by the Seller to get approved to join the Amazon Associates program has been using the same tracking IDs as the primary site and will be included in the sale. The additional site has social media profiles and content of its own, but has not been touched since 2015. The older site isnâ€™t in a related niche and sales on Amazon have seeminglyÂ been insignificant.    *Â In March 2018, the spike in traffic was caused by aÂ \"ghost spam\"Â issue.

The business has year-over-yearÂ growth and requires minimal work from the Seller due to a team in place.    The first business brings in about 75% of the total revenue. The products areÂ print-on-demand, so they are untouched by the Seller and the team. This business has a Shopify site withÂ Instagram, Facebook, and Pinterest accounts. The social media accounts arenâ€™t significant for the business in terms of sales, but are maintained for branding.    The second business is entirely an Amazon FBA business and sells products in the home &amp; garden niche. The business stores inventory with Amazon, a US-based supplier, and an overseas factory. The US-based supplier ships inventory to Amazon's warehouses, so the Seller doesn't have to keep any stock themselves. There are also 2 Shopify sites for this FBA business used mostly for branding.    The Seller has a team of six employees in place who manage most of the operations for the business, including customer service, fulfillment support and graphic design. The Seller spends about 10 hours per week on the business, doing a weekly accounting review for each business and managing the staff. The employees are unaware of the sale, but the Seller is confident they will continue with the Buyer since they are remote.    * These businesses could be sold separately, but packaging them together allows the Buyer to qualify for an SBA loan.

The Shopify site sells numerous accessory products for mobile devices, but is known for one specific product type. This is an established business with a massive social media presence and email list.    The top sources of traffic for this business are direct and social media. Social media accounts associated with the brand include Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube. Instagram has the largest following with over 600k followers in total. The pages are integral to the core of the business and content it shares.    The business procured hundreds of videos from influencers and videographers when it first launched. They still chop up new videos and make different edits to existing raw footage on a monthly basis.Â Due to the nature ofÂ the main product, new content is generated organically on Instagram, YouTube, Snap, and Twitter. This content is then used in advertisements. Additionally, theÂ brand has been written about on major sites and had numerous free celebrity/athlete endorsements.    The associated email list has over 300k subscribers. There is also an SMS campaign list with over 200k members. These are not currentlyÂ being monetized, making them growth opportunities for the Buyer to consider.    When it comes to work required for maintaining this business, everything is done in-house except fulfillment/storage which is handledÂ by a 3PL company. There are 2 dedicated employees currentlyÂ working on this specific business â€” one for customer service and one for marketing.    * The Seller's agencyÂ is willing to continue handling any or all of the daily/weekly tasks for the Buyer at an agreed upon rate.Â More information can be provided to active depositors.

      "long_descr": "This listing is for a dropshipping and ecommerce business created in December 2015 in the jewelry &amp; accessories niche. The Shopify site primarily features unique jewelry, with over 1500 products currentlyÂ listed and more added every day. Three VAs help make the store run on automated systems, so the Seller can spend minimal time working on the business. With 260K+ social followers and a strong email list of 220K+, this business has a clear path outlined for growth.    As a marketing strategy, the business has used Facebook to promote the store and its products. The hard work and development have paid off andÂ these days the Facebook advertising works sustainably, almost on auto-pilot. Thanks to the large following, the Seller can spotÂ the winning posts published on the page and then create paid campaigns for them. These tasks could be delegated to one of the VAs as well if the Buyer wished to do so.    The VAs handle the vast majority of order fulfillment, customer service, Facebook posting and day-to-day operations. They also process the fulfillment of any orders that come in for a jewelry line that is not dropshipped. This line is stored with FBA, though sold only on the Shopify site. This process is made even smoother with procedures and tools like Zendesk in place. This allows the Seller to focus on paid ads, email marketing, and the high-level tasks of company finances and managing the VAs.    It is worth noting, the Buyer does not need to be a Facebook marketing \"expert\" to continue to be successful with Facebook advertising. The Seller feels they will be able to easily train the Buyer on how to do it and how to continue the same processes, and it will not take much time.    While most of the traffic is from social, a nice 15% is direct traffic that seems to be from returning users, and almost 10% is from organic traffic without any SEO efforts being made. This is an opportunity for the Buyer to expand. With such a large internal audience, the Seller suggests that the best opportunity for growth is to focus on the email list as it much easier, and significantly cheaper, to generate revenue from existing customers than it is to find new customers.    *The Seller is including in the sale, a subscription box service that was launched in December of 2017. This part of the business has been managed by the Seller'sÂ partnerÂ and is in the same niche. This subscription box service has its own website, customers, and email list, and some cross-marketing is done with the main site as it is a nice complimentary service. The subscription box service can be separated and operated as a business on its own. As the profits from this new venture continue to grow, the Seller suggests the new owner outsource this work to an employee to help the subscription service expand quickly. Since its launch, it's brought in around 10% of the revenue for the business.    *In February 2016, PayPal limited the ability to receive payments to the PayPal account. In response, the Seller created a new LLC company and a new PayPal account specifically for this business. This account is active and in good standing to this day.    *In November 2017Â Facebook deactivated the Business Manager account because of ads run on a different ecommerceÂ profile (unrelated niche). Even though the Ads Account of this business was separate, the access to this account was restrictedÂ as well. After a few weeks of reorganization, the Seller opened a new Ads Account solely for this business, which is working well and in good standing to this day.

It also offers minimal work to maintain for those seeking to add this business as part of an on-going portfolio.    One product earns the vast majority of revenue throughout the year, with others doing well during their targeted seasons or occasions.

A narrator for the audiobooks was found on ACX and the books were paid for outright.    * The Seller is including a non-monetized Merch by Amazon account in the sale.    * In June 2017, one of the Sellerâ€™s series received reports of copyright violations.

      "long_descr": "This listing is for an Amazon Merch and dropshipping business created in October 2015 in the apparel &amp; accessories niche. The businessÂ was initially selling on TeeSpring until Merch by Amazon was launched. The SellerÂ quickly re-purposed their designs for the Amazon marketplace and other secondary POD marketplaces to further monetize inventory. Almost 45k designs areÂ live on Amazon with a limit of 56k design slots available.    Outside of Amazon, the site earns revenue from a branded Shopify site and other print-on-demand marketplaces such as RedBubble, Etsy, TeeSpring, Spreadshirt, CafePress, and more. These secondary channels make up about a quarter of overall monthly profit. Numerous social media profiles have been created to market the products and several email lists exist across the platforms. The main email list from the Shopify site has about 2k subscribers and has been emailed occasionally with offers.    While the Seller has primarily relied on organic traffic on Amazon, social media and AMS ads have also contributed.Â The Merch by Amazon account is approved to run ads in the Amazon UK and Germany marketplaces where monthly sales are already taking place.    The Seller has recently spent their time on the business re-purposing existing designs onto new products made available on the various platforms. This amounts to about 5 to 15 hours per week. Buyers interested in growing the business further may wish to follow this path and continue uploading older designs for new product types.Â For new designs, the Seller creates some themselves, but has also used one designer for over 2 years. They've used outsourced employees intermittently over the past 3 years and is happy to pass along details for them to the Buyer.    * Merch by AmazonÂ reports numbers for the previous month during the latter part of the following month, soÂ some stats may be delayed below.    * Since this is a design-based business, the Seller has occasionally received rejections, notices, take down requests, cease and desist letters, etc. related to their designs. They'veÂ reconciled issues,Â typically removing designs instead of fighting it unless it was a false notice. These don't happen often and have occurred without noticeable affects to account standings.Â The MBA ecosystem, for one, is ever changing and many sellers file for trademarks on phrases. In doing so, they file take down notices against sellers that are already selling a product with the exact phrase.  See the link for more details regarding earnings and traffic.",

      "long_descr": "This listing is for an Amazon FBM and ecommerce business created in July 2017 in the home decor niche. The business features 60 SKUs for printed decorations available on Amazon, Etsy, and ZulilyÂ related to a specific theme. A 3rd party printing company prints, stores, fulfills and ships all products sold through each of the channels, so the Seller doesn't have to touch the inventory.    The businessÂ is a part of Amazon's Brand Registry program and is set up for Seller Fulfilled Prime with a 100% success rate of on-time shipping. For Amazon and Zulily, the inventory is printed ahead of time and sits as stock untilÂ an order is placed. For Etsy, a hybrid model is in place where some orders areÂ shipped from stock, while others areÂ printed on demand and shipped.Â On Amazon, the business sells in the US only, but itÂ is set up to sell on Amazon Canada and Mexico too. Etsy orders are shipped internationally.    The Seller spends between 10 and 20 hours per week working on this business. Since they are also the artist for the products, they spend time on creation â€” something that can be outsourced. In the past, they've licensed other artwork to sell while paying royalties to the artists. This is an opportunity for the Buyer to consider doing again to grow the business. The Seller hasn't created a social media presence â€” another opportunity for the Buyer.    See the link for more details regarding earnings and traffic.",

The company has a strong customer base, a well-trained team, and a reputation as a leader in the field.  Although based in the Dallas, TX area, the company has done major projects all across the United States and can be relocated anywhere.    About the company    Advanced Pipe Repair was started in the summer of 2006 when the current owner discovered a new technology being used in Europe changing the way pipes are restored.  Using a technology called CIPP (Cured in Place Pipe) a sleeve is put inside a pipe and then through a process cured in place.  This allows large diameter pipes to be repaired without the expensive and invasive process of digging.    Over the last 12 years Advanced Pipe Repair serves mid-size commercial businesses completing hundreds of jobs ranging from $10,000 to $300,000.  They have built a well-trained, small team that understand the technology and are skilled in the process.  They pride themselves in being able to think outside the box bringing solutions to their customers that result in superior results for less money.    About the products    CIPP â€“ This has been the bread and butter for Advanced Pipe Repair.  Cured-in-place pipe (CIPP) is a trenchless (or no-dig) pipeline rehabilitation process involving a textile liner tube and liquid resin combination.    Epoxy â€“ This is another â€œno digâ€ solutions used for pipes with more turns and bends.  It is a simpler method for smaller jobs.",

Dallas County recently purchased the 11acres diagonally across the street and are building a 69,000 sq foot building for courthouses and offices, which will mean a lot more cars and will make this intersection one of the safest in Dallas.    Car Wash 2) Just 6 miles down the road in city of Duncanville    The Duncanville location has a new Walmart diagonally across from it now (which was formerly vacant land) which has really helped give a boost and continues to help as more people realize the car wash is there. The land previously was vacant for decades. Also, I received notice in the mail last summer that the huge 8+ acres of vacant land across the street of the car wash (west side) is being zoned for commercial, and going to have a strip mall with a grocery store in it.  Not sure on its start-date, but occasionally see surveyors over there.  So this intersection is going to be even busier soon. Obviously once Walmart shows up, other businesses show up.",

There is plenty of room to extend the brand inside the Amazon ecosystem by expanding into other geographies (EU, JP, Etc.) or into other product areas.   In addition to Amazon, applying focus on the companyâ€™s Shopify website along with other marketing channels like AdWords, Facebook and Instagram offer additional growth opportunities that can be leveraged quickly as the company has already established fulfillment within the US and has the stable vendor relationships required to support the growth.",

      "long_descr": "The company is a successful vinyl window business serving metro Atlanta that specializes in installing replacement windows and patio doors. It is currently up for sale to qualified buyers exclusively through Raincatcher. The company provides quality vinyl window solutions at a value price. The company maintains very low overhead in order to offer its customers the best price on windows. In general, it beats its competitor's pricing by 18% on all orders. Because of its unbeatable pricing,Â the company does a very high volume of sales on its products. The company provides an excellent opportunity for a buyer to enjoy predictable cash flow and a swift return on investment.    The vinyl window industry accounts for 60% of all window sales in the US. Vinyl windows were once considered a solution primarily for starter homes. However, manufacturers have started producing various levels of windows for different markets and price points, including custom homes. With continued new home construction and renovations of existing homes, the demand for windows and doors is expected to rise annually by 4.8% to a $34.3 billion dollar industry by 2021. Expanding commercial construction on new offices, retail, and lodging will also continue to drive the sale of windows and doors.    The company provides vinyl windows to homeowners, investors, and contractors. The Company is highly competitive in the metro Atlanta market due to its low prices. The Company opened in 2015 and has been extremely busy since the very first month of operation.    The overall Sellability Score the company received was a 58. This score is an analysis ofÂ business performance on eight attributes proven to be important to acquiring companies, the company rated particularly high in the areas The Switzerland Score (84) and Customer Satisfaction (94). The Switzerland Structure attribute is an indication of a businessâ€™s reliability on any one customer, employee or supplier. The company's score of 84 shows they are performing very well in this area. The Customer Satisfaction attribute measures both the extent to which customer are satisfied and the businesses ability to assess customer satisfaction in a consistent and rigorous way. The company's score of 94 is above average compared to other businesses.    The company does not carry any long-term debt. It is a great opportunity for a company or individual interested in capitalizing on the high demand for windows in the metro Atlanta area.    Purchase Considerations:    - High conversion rate from interest to sales due to low pricing.  - Low overhead and low marketing/advertising costs.  - Strong margins and cash flow.  - High demand for vinyl windows in the current economy.    The company is equally owned by two partners who plan to exit the industry following the transaction. This is an asset purchase that includes all the assets and liabilities of the Company.

Each store is located in Bonita Springs or Naples in highly desirable, upscale plazas with long term leases in place. The plant handles the work for all of the drop stores as well as other drop stores not owned by us and commercial accounts. The breakdown is as follows. We will sell the plant individually for $110k, 1 of the drop stores that is brand new for less than it cost to setup which is $25k and the other established drop store for $65k. We also have another drop store that is only 14 months old in a brand new plaza at a major intersection in Naples. It was under contract but the buyer couldn't perform. That store is also listed individually at $65000. Or you can take the whole package with a competitive offer above $200k. Window shoppers, please don't waste my time or yours. If I had time to waste, I wouldn't be selling and I would be out there making this business into a cash machine. Mix and match but don't drag your feet, if you want a business to grow with all of the components in place, now is the time to make a move. We also have a 2016 Ford Transit 250 that is outfitted for transport that we would sell in the deal for what is owed which I believe is around $20k or so. To set just the plant up right now would cost over $400k and that's if you could find a landlord willing to rent to a dry cleaning plant. Pick up the plant and beautiful drop stores for peanuts and take this business to the next level. My other business interests keep me from being there enough and I don't want to ruin 20 year friendships over a business. If you jump in at these prices, that is the steal of the century.

This boutique has been a passion project of mine since I started it in June 2017 and something I've taken great delight both in developing the business, and creating unique designs for. I've been lucky enough to stumble across a hot niche market (Milestone Blankets for Baby Showers/Baby Registries and happily have over 50 5-star reviews on Etsy.) Sure... 50 isn't a huge number but if you consider these days that most people only leave reviews to complain... I'm happy to take 50 5-stars with no bad comments/reviews! I've decided to sell Sweet Chickadee purely because I just don't have the time. With 2 little girls and a multitude of other life occurrences, I just don't have the time to take it to the next level. I do have a plan though... and that next level marketing plan will come with the business as well. This opportunity would be the perfect fulfilling job for a stay-at-home mom/moms, marketing graduate, or female entrepreneur.    Business comes with:  - Over $10,000 worth of inventory  - E-commerce website (shopify): www.sweetchickadee.com  - Current shopping platforms (website, etsy shop, amazon shop, momsandmamas.com)  - Social Media sites: Facebook, Instagram & Pinterest  - All unique designs and design files  - All photography  - All manufacturing contacts  - All marketing materials  - Celebrity contacts  - Fully transparent P&L    I've done all the heavy lifting (legal documentation, manufacturing relations, website development, product design, marketplace integration, social media development, ), but Sweet Chickadee needs someone who can put in some time!    I've had wonderful success and nothing but amazing feedback thus far, and haven't yet even begun to explore:  + attending/having a booth at events and marketplace fairs (standing invite from a few!)  + drop-shipping  + blogger outreach & reviews  + trunk shows at local boutiques  + retailing at local boutiques  + local PR & national PR campaigns  + Social Media Influencers & Reviewers  + SEO & Adwords  + email blasts & email campaigns  + boy apparel  + Wholesale  ... So, with the ability to work from anywhere and a steady stream of income, there is huge promise and opportunity for someone who has the time and drive!",

Extreme - From the Start  Todd Parent-Founder Itâ€™s only natural that CEO Todd Parent would be the founder of a fresh concept named... Extreme Pizza. Born within the New York Metropolitan Area, Todd grew up on pizza. An avowed fan of extreme sports such as mountain biking, windsurfing, sailing, kite sailing and downhill skiing, Todd used his love for fierce competition and his culinary roots to formulate a concept devoted to serving the perfect pizza.    After receiving his degree in economics and working for a few years on Wall Street, Todd decided to pursue his heart and embarked on a culinary career. While studying in France, he was intrigued by flocks of Parisians gathered at crepe stands for meals-to-go. This would spark his inspiration to offer Americans a gourmet alternative to fast food.    Based on his love of New York pizza, Todd took the novel approach of using super-premium healthier ingredients, fast-fresh made-to-order pizza formulation and added a dash of California creativity. The award winning Extreme Pizza was born!  Today, Extreme Pizza has franchise units from coast to coast. Todd says he owes the company success to itâ€™s focus on innovation in both its products and company practices. We all believe that some of that success can be traced back to naming the company after the extreme sports that we all love, and of course... his employee's crazed enthusiasm for great piz",

This is a fantastic business model that comes with training, web site, and all the tools for estimating and making sure a buyer will be successful. The business can be run from home or a small office and does not require a yard or lots of employees. Most painters are subcontractors as well as the estimators or salespeople that go and get the jobs can be part-time or full time or if the owner likes this type of work they can do it themselves. The seller or holder of the franchise will pay the handover fee of $12,500 so that the buyer can go to the franchise school and receive a total education in the retail painting business as well as an insight into the commercial side of the painting industry. The seller is currently not operating at this time as he has a sick mother in another State that he must look after. The territory is Central Florido or anywhere that is an area that is not being operated by an active Franchisee.   Financing is readily available including working capital to a buyer with good credit.  This is not a rinkey dink franchise but a franchise that is well run, organised and supports your business with every tool and marketing avenue possible to make you a successful business person.  This franchise is ideal for an E-2 or L-1 applicant.  It can be run by anyone, man or woman and you do not have to be a painter or do any painting, you do not have to be a super sale person or even go to see the customer if you do not want too, estimators and painters are available on a contract basis if you just want to be an overseer or total business person!.  Retail is by far the best side of the business as you get paid up front and when the job is done. The commercial side is very good but you need more working capital but financing is readily available.",

      "long_descr": "If you've been looking for the right route in the Austin/Westlake area this is it. With an average billing of $217 per client your profit margins are among the best in the industry. The route grosses $8,717 per month on only 40 accounts. The route now comes with an employee to make the transition seamless. A leased truck is also available for an additional cost.    More information:  What is a pool route? Itâ€™s a group of accounts being sold by a pool company. Typically itâ€™s being sold to fund other ventures or as part of a retirement plan.  Why are pool routes better than buying a traditional business? If you compare incomes vs asking prices itâ€™s very clear. A route generating $50,000 per year will sell for roughly $50,000. A traditional business making the same income would cost $100,000 or more to purchase. There are other great benefits as well. Give us a call to learn more.  At Sealey Business Brokers we want you to get started off on the right foot so every route includes a free Certified Pool Operators Course (CPO) and a copy of Quickbooks. Also included with every route is our free consultation to share our almost 10 years of experience in the swimming pool industry.",

The shop does business all along the Southwest Coast of Florida and makes award winning products for high end residential and commercial clients. They have built a strong reputation in the industry for â€œOld Worldâ€ craftsmanship and have been serving customers in the area for 35+ years. A new owner would be the beneficiary of the name recognition and reputation that this company has built over it's 35+ years in business.  The bulk of their business is retail residential which makes up roughly 70% of the business.  The other 30% comes from designers & decorators, furniture stores & commercial accounts.    This business currently generates â€œFree Cash Flowâ€ of $375,000 annually, resulting in a very attractive â€œOwners Benefitâ€.

One or two good sales people could be hired and be paid strictly on a commission basis for the generation of new business.     Upholstery experience is a big plus, but not a must, as an investor could oversee this operation with an experienced upholsterer running the back-room operation. One of the current owners is hands on in the shop and oversees that operation on a daily basis.  The owners are currently looking for a back-room manager with a strong background in the upholstery business.        The owners run this business out of a 9,000-square foot industrial facility.  The building consists of roughly 2,100 Square feet of Office/Showroom space and 6,900 square feet of warehouse space. The showroom and a large portion of the warehouse have air conditioning.  The showroom is the largest along the Southwest Coast of Florida and has the largest choice of fabrics to choose from.     The real estate is available for sale and has a  current estimated market value of roughly  $600,000.

There is also opportunity to create an absentee ownership situation with minimal work.    The opportunities to grow the business are low-hanging with zero advertising being done over the last 5 years and a static website from the 90s. Ownership simply hasnâ€™t tried to grow the business and the opportunity to leverage the incredible goodwill of the company with a modern website and targeted advertising could dramatically increase the foot-traffic for minimal capital outlay. The store recently received a half-million dollar facelift leaving no required CAPEX injection to maintain and grow earnings. This opportunity will not last and is priced to sell.

      "long_descr": "All Pro Landscapes is a family owned company with an excellent reputation and established commercial and residential monthly lawn care accounts and landscape construction customers acquired throughout our 14 years of activity. We provide year round lawn and garden maintenance service, sprinkler system repair, start-up & winterizing services and installations, SOD installations, paver installations, retaining walls, complete yard makeovers, water feature installations, landscape design and plant installations, fence and deck installations. All of our construction services are custom made, offers made through in-home consultations to our qualified customers acquired from incoming calls, our database, local trade shows or local print EveryDoorDirectMail advertising. We service Snohomish and King counties. We presently have 20 regular lawn and garden maintenance customers which we service and invoice every month for an average monthly income of approximately $6000. They are split 50/50 between commercial and residential properties.     Our business is fully registered, licensed, bonded and insured in the State of Washington with an impeccable service record and free of legal claims, tax liens, local, state or federal audits. All our bookkeeping, accounting, tax payments and debts are up-to-date, paid or covered with funds in reserves. The business is 100% solvent, profitable and in the black.    A turn key operation for a new or experienced business owner that wants to walk in and hit the ground running. There's more business than we can handle aways and we sadly turn away more customers than we can service. Our mission statement is to treat our customers like we treat our friends and family - fairly, professionally and committed to their satisfaction. We invested our returns and profits into our retirement home. We decided early on we did not want to grow the business and proactively decided to keep it to 5 to 6 employees year round. My wife and I run the office and the crews. She is more involved in the office duties and plant designs while I run most of the service and construction trades. However, we learned how to do a little bit of everything. We operate the business with one part-time accountant and two to three crew members. At times we use sub-contractors - who are also licensed, bonded, insured and in our database. However, a go-getter business type could easily reinvest into the business and have a fleet and bigger crew within a year or less. The business and profits are there, it simply requires a good business manager with that purpose in mind. We have not borrowed from the bank, it is a cash based business and the way we run it, it can be grown with its own cash flow.    We will provide up to one year of free support to the new owner and do our best to help gen them in to all the successful or tried and true actions that helped us fulfill our dream of building our retirement home, staying debt free and having fun while we worked in this rewarding industry. There are bigger landscape companies than us out there but we found our niche in the market place and it is to be friendly, personable and caring to our customers and prospects and to provide free custom in-home consultations and estimates to qualified customers and to then deliver what we promised, all at a profit so we could pay our employees, our suppliers, our taxes and finally ourselves and our dream. This is a turn key operation truly, walk in, learn the ropes and don't bother to walk. However, I would be lying, if you told you, it's a lazy lifestyle. Don't even bother reading the rest of the information, if you want to avoid work. Successful business owners know this truism quite well. If you're still reading and you're not afraid of hard work, give me a call 425-524-7730 or email me Alejandro@APLSeattle.com I'll be happy to answer any questions. Attaining ones goals the old fashion way is one of the most uplifting and rewarding of ways to succeed in life.",

      "long_descr": "This business is a retailer of planners. The brand operates mostly on Amazon U.S. with some sales coming from its own shopify website. The brand has 2 undated editions: weekly and daily, with stellar product and seller ratings of 4.7 and 4.1 Stars and 250+ Product Reviews.  The brand does not need to pay for extra marketing or Amazon advertising.  Sales are organic, which means its net income of $60,000 a year ($42,391 after reinvestment in inventory) is passive with little to none maintenance of its Instagram and FB pages.      The product is manufactured in China.  The designs are set and ready to go, all you need are PDFs for print. The manufacturer packages and ships the product directly to Amazon FBA centers as well as to a home in the US where it is used to facilitate orders taken on the website.    With very little to no physical inventory to handle/store, this business is home-based, easily relocatable and can be operated from any location with internet access. It is also operable by one person.     This company is an excellent acquisition target for anyone currently selling on Amazon or looking to enter the platform. The established brand, with sales and reviews in place offer excellent stability and a springboard for future growth. There is plenty of room to include new products and extend the brand outside and inside the Amazon ecosystem. Most of our international buyers are from Australia, followed by U.K, Canada and France. In addition to Amazon, applying focus on the companyâ€™s Shopify website along with other marketing channels like AdWords, Facebook and Instagram would offer even more growth opportunities that can be leveraged quickly.

The seller is motivated and ready to sell now which is why the listing price is reduced.    More information:  What is a pool route? Itâ€™s a group of accounts being sold by a pool company. Typically itâ€™s being sold to fund other ventures or as part of a retirement plan.  Why are pool routes better than buying a traditional business? If you compare incomes vs asking prices itâ€™s very clear. A route generating $50,000 per year will sell for roughly $50,000. A traditional business making the same income would cost $100,000 or more to purchase. There are other great benefits as well. Give us a call to learn more.

      "long_descr": "This business is a modernly equipped, personal training professional fitness center.    The partner-training business model inspires clients with more than a gym membership.  Training takes place at two locations. The first is an 1821 square foot gym near the downtown commercial core. Seattle currently has a daily population of approximately 668,000 people. Many of the client base work at Amazon, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Starbucks Corporate, and other area businesses.  As development continues in this area, the number of residents and employees will continue to grow.  The local population is a perfect demographic for a gym with a median household income of approximately $83,500 per year, average age of 33, and an average household size of 1.4 people.         The second location opened in 2017 to address customer demand. The gross revenue of the business increased 79% between 2016 & 2017.  2018 revenue increased over 2017 by over 17%.   This  1344 square foot gym allows the business to address peak demand during select hours.          The likelihood of new competition entering the marketplace offering a similar fitness service is very low given the size of this unique business model and staff of training partners.      The staff of 15-17 works between the two locations. Ownership fills an executive management role in the business.     The lead business broker for this company at IBA is Jeff Bryan.  Mr. Bryan can be contacted directly at (425) 454-3052 or jeff@ibainc.com.",

Birmingham just approved funding for an expansion to the civic center and a brand new football stadium. That means more visitors, and in turn more traffic into your business! This franchise for sale is located in the uptown area of Birmingham where there has and continues to be a great deal of growth. A brand new Topgolf location just opened close to where this business is located. The city is currently in discussions to build a brand-new football stadium as well! You'll be right in the center of the cultural scene of Birmingham, and patrons of the arts will love to stop in before or after a show to enjoy a slice of pizza and a glass of wine!",

      "long_descr": "This listing offers a unique opportunity to acquire future powerhouse in the lucrative fitness market and is an ideal acquisition target for strategic buyers in this space that have the existing infrastructure in place and marketing skills to readily scale the brand to its full potential.      The initial structure of the business was established in order to build brand recognition and amass leads: customers, traffic, social media network, etc..  Having accomplished these goals, the next step is for the company to monetize its massive network by having a deeper product line to promote to its existing and future audience.  With a deeper product line and the same previous $100k marketing spend, this business has the potential to go from a $1.75 million business with 10-20% profit margin to a $5 million business with similar overhead.     With an abundance of leads and without yet a sufficient quantity of products/services currently in place to effectively grow the business to its next level, the owners made a strategic decision to reduce marketing spend which has resulted in lower revenues, but higher margins.  The owners have streamlined the business maintaining it at a stable level until the product line can be sufficiently expanded to provide a purpose to and warrant to an increase in marketing spend for overall expansion of the company.         Business Overview and Asset Portfolio   This listing is for a premier health and fitness brand and is an asset sale based on its portfolio which includes:   â€¢                 Tens of thousands of unique visitors per month  â€¢                 30,000 customers on its workout program  â€¢                 2 million Facebook fans with pages that have extremely high engagement  â€¢                 70,000 members on its Facebook group Fitness Enthusiasts  â€¢                 300,000+ e-mail subscribers  â€¢                 2 iTunes albums that generated over 5 million streams  â€¢                 Generated over $2.8 Million in Revenue over the last 2 fiscal years from two main revenue streams: pay for work out program and two iTunes albums.     With millions of social media fans and a tremendous brand presence, this brand is a growing force in the fitness space with tremendous potential.  As a trusted information source, the company has tapped into several fitness verticals with success.  This brand is ready to tap into the supplement and apparel market based on its success.  Once a deep product line and manpower is put behind the brand, it will grow into a deca-million dollar business by leveraging the audience base, forming the right partnerships, private labeling its digital programs to gym chains, and expanding the product line to include supplements, wearable technology, mobile apps, nutrition based businesses, apparel, etc.     It was always planned for this brand to be the leader of â€œworking outâ€ in a space that has lots of companies that focus on niche markets â€“ i.e., bodybuilding, apparel, supplements, gyms, cycling, etcâ€¦  The space is neglected of a brand that has everything-fitness-related under one brand that people trust and view as a reputable source to buy a wide range of health and fitness products from.",

Can't miss opportunity offered by We Sell Restaurants.  This well-established frozen yogurt franchise for sale is in a famed Central Texas college town.  It is in a prime location less than a mile from campus and on the main road that runs directly through the town!  An owner / operator would have 2017 cash flow of over $85,000! Sweet treat served in like this is one of the most operationally easy restaurants to run.  The operations are streamlined and this frozen yogurt franchise for sale model requires fewer employees than a regular restaurant.  This location has an ample 60 seats inside and 16 seats out front.  Rent is a reasonable $5,100 a month, including CAMS.  The frozen yogurt franchise for sale is clearly visible from the main thoroughfare, and there is parking right out front.  Although this location is making money, it also presents a clear turn-around opportunity.  The current owner knows full well that the frozen yogurt franchise for sale would make more money if he were more involved, but he has been close to retirement and made the decision to be an absentee owner.  In fact, the store is only for sale now because he has decided to fully retire.  In 2016, for example, the owner / operator would have had cash flow of over $120,000!  This frozen yogurt franchise for sale location has been priced based on the lower sales, even though it is evident that an involved owner -- someone who could do more marketing, greet customers, make sure everything was clean and well-run -- could quickly bring sales back up, and even higher than before.  College students, and everyone else, still want and love their froyo! It is also worth noting that this store is special:  It is the winner of the &quot;froyo wars.&quot;  Another frozen yogurt store used to be across the street and a third was very close by, but they are both long gone.  This location is known for its value, and for the price-conscious college-aged consumer, this franchise is the clear favorite.   The current owner is retiring, putting this frozen yogurt franchise for sale location on the market for a savvy buyer. This creates a fantastic opportunity for you to own a successful, money-making business, and to build your own equity by taking it to the next level.  Bank financing would be available to qualified buyers, meaning for a 20% down payment, you could be the owner of this amazing Frozen Yogurt Franchise for sale!

Customers continually come back to them due to quality, consistency and value.     The Company specializes in a niche market, maintains a well-honed product catalog and does not face any domestic competition. Recent tariffs have made foreign competitors less competitive, thus positioning the company for growth under a new owner (as the present owner is tired and has no desire to grow). The Company provides services to a diverse customer base including those in distributing, manufacturing, and other sectors.    The owner is in his 70s and desires to slow down and transition into retirement. Therefore, he has decided it is time to transition the business to new owners with a vision to grow and sustain the business for many more years to come.",

The route comes with a 90 day guarantee and an employee is available to come with the route.     More information:  What is a pool route? Itâ€™s a group of accounts being sold by a pool company. Typically itâ€™s being sold to fund other ventures or as part of a retirement plan.    Why are pool routes better than buying a traditional business? If you compare incomes vs asking prices itâ€™s very clear. A route generating $50,000 per year will sell for roughly $50,000. A traditional business making the same income would cost $100,000 or more to purchase. There are other great benefits as well. Give us a call to learn more.  At Sealey Business Brokers we want you to get started off on the right foot so every route includes a free Certified Pool Operators Course (CPO) and a copy of Quickbooks. Also included with every route is our free consultation to share our almost 10 years of experience in the swimming pool industry.",

Partnering with local schools and libraries, it is the Companyâ€™s mission to encourage childrenâ€™s curiosity towards STEM subjects and possible career paths in the STEM field. Unlike its competitors, the Companyâ€™s labs can be taken on the road, frequently making trips to local schools and libraries instead of making its customers come to them.    Each lab session is taught by a dynamic and patient instructor with a professional and simple to follow lesson plan. The sessions always include spectacular scientific demonstrations, inquiry-based discussions, and each child getting to take something home something they made themselves. Ending projects have included everything from model rockets to slime. On top of its after school programs, the Company also offers birthday party packages, summer day camps, in-class workshops, and stage shows.

Itâ€™s a group of accounts being sold by a pool company. Typically itâ€™s being sold to fund other ventures or as part of a retirement plan.  Why are pool routes better than buying a traditional business? If you compare incomes vs asking prices itâ€™s very clear. A route generating $50,000 per year will sell for roughly $50,000. A traditional business making the same income would cost $100,000 or more to purchase. There are other great benefits as well. Give us a call to learn more.

While the way we serve our product is unique, our customer service, interaction and approachability is what makes Screenmobile unique, and is the reason for our strong national growth.    How Our Business Model Works  Our trucks and screening trailers, which are what allow our Franchise Owners to screen on-site and in real time, are the focal points of our business model. This is what puts the mobile in Screenmobile! Additionally, due to the setup and branding of the modernized trailer, weâ€™ve seen a significant increase in job requests from â€˜walk-upâ€™ clients - which we encourage.    As a result of our own ongoing corporate support, Screenmobile currently has a 99% renewal rate of our Franchise Owners.    Why Franchise Owners Love the Business    Zero National Competition: Screenmobile is the only screening company offering a mobile workshop that completes jobs on-site. We offer a major convenience to our customers by not requiring that they disassemble and drag large screens to their nearest Home Depot or Lowes.  Freedom & Flexibility: Our business model affords our partners the freedom to build a stable and prosperous business while enjoying a flexible schedule and a healthy work-life balance. This is why we are a Monday-Friday, 7am-5pm business where the choice to leave weekends optional is made by each owner.  Untapped Potential: We might be the only business where our Franchise Ownersâ€™ biggest problem is too many customers and too many jobs to complete! With the combination of an exponential amount of screens in every territory and the reputation that weâ€™ve built over the past 35+ years, our owners are constantly prepared for their phones to be ringing off the hook with business.",

Electrical construction services generally fall into one of three categories: large installation projects that involve construction of manufacturing and commercial buildings (multi-million-dollar range); large and medium sized capital and maintenance projects for manufacturing and industrial clients; and smaller installation projects involving fit-out, renovation and retrofit work. The average job size is $350,000 and the company does 25 â€“ 35 jobs a year.     Owner Involvement    Over the years, the owner has made a conscious decision to instill well-defined systems and processes to help increase the efficiently of the business. The business runs as a turnkey operation and the owner is truly an overseer and focuses on long-term strategic goals as well as quality control. Many of the customer and supplier relationships are not controlled / managed by the owner but are maintained through the project managers.     Licenses / Qualifications    To operate this business in the State of Texas, someone in the company must have and maintain a master electrical license. Currently, the company is operating under the ownerâ€™s master electrical license however if the new buyer does not have the license; there are two individuals on staff with the master electrical license.     Key Strengths    1) Highly-Regarded and Well-Established: Started in 1994 / 24 Years   2) Company has developed deep relationships with its customers   3) Processes for all departments, all departments work collectively and efficiently   4) Very experienced labor force / long-term employees with very high morale.    Possible Weaknesses    1) While the company has been able to grow profits, there is no sales team.   2) Currently, the service area only covers Dallas-Fort Worth  3) Only 10% of revenue comes from recurring maintenance / room to improve.   4) Over the last 24 years, the company has identified a core group of general contractors, developers and building owners they like to work with and have primarily focused on serving this group as oppose to actively engaging new customers. A new buyer may want to expand the companyâ€™s customer base.    Employees    The companyâ€™s personnel changes depending on the work level but general stays in the 35 â€“ 45 employee range. The key employees are the two project managers (one has been with the company for ten years and the other one for seven years) and the senior estimator who has been with the company for 20 years. Both project managers hold a master electrical license.     Excluding the owner, there are two family members that actively work in the business. These family members are paid a fair market salary and would be open to staying with the business post-sale.",
